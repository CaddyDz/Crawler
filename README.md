# PyTest
Python learning repository (nothing probably useful)  
I usually use thenewboston's video tutorial playlist but decided to skip that and use the official documentation at python.org this time.  
Already finished Derek Banas's Video tutorial (although I feel I need to recap)  
Currently working on a book titles 'Python Guide'
